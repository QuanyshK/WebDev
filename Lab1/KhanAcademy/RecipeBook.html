<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
    <br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.
    <br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.
    <br><strong>Step 4:</strong>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.
    <br><strong>Step 5:</strong>Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.
    <br><strong>Step 6:</strong>Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
    <br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.
    <br><strong>Step 3:</strong>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.
    <br><strong>Step 4:</strong>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.
    <br><strong>Step 5:</strong>Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown chicken in oil and butter for 5 to 7 minutes per side; remove from skillet, and set aside.
    <br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place artichoke hearts and mushrooms in the skillet, and saute until mushrooms are brown and tender. Return chicken to skillet, and pour in reserved artichoke liquid and wine. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
    <br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Stir in capers, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove from heat; serve immediately.
