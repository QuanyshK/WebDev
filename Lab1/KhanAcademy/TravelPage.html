<p><em> Hokkaido is Japan's northernmost island, and it's an enormous place! In fact, the area of Hokkaido is 22% of Japan's total surface area – nearly a quarter of the country – making it Japan's largest prefecture. An important thing to note is that Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital city, is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) away from New Chitose Airport.</em>    <h3> 2. When is the best time to visit Hokkaido?</h3>

<br> <em>Note that Hokkaido is located at a northern latitude of 41 to 45 degrees, which puts it at the same latitude as other colder regions in the world, such as the southern-central region of France, the northern region of Spain, northern-central region of Italy, New York City, and Toronto, and temperatures may fluctuate by quite a lot in the same day alone.</em>
<h3>3. What are Hokkaido's main places and best things to do there?</h3>

<strong>Sapporo</strong>
<br><em>
    As mentioned earlier, this is the main city of Hokkaido, where there are great places to shop, eat, sightsee, or relax at almost every corner. The Sapporo Clock Tower and Sapporo Hitsujigaoka Observation Hill are a couple of the more iconic sightseeing places of interest here, which should definitely consider visiting if you haven't already.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Niseko</strong>
<br>
<em>The Niseko area stretches out at the foot of Mount Yotei and is globally renowned for its high-quality powder snow. Needless to say, this is a popular place for trying out some winter sports. However, even if you are visiting during summer, you're welcome to join in any one of the outdoor activities being held here as well, such as river rafting!</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Hakodate</strong>
<br>
<em>The central area of southern Hokkaido. Here is where you'll find beautiful city nightscapes and plenty of historical buildings that are an exciting mix of styles from the East and West. Some local specialties you can find in the markets here are fresh seafood and tasty Western confectionery.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Asahikawa / Northern Hokkaido</strong>
<br>
<em>One can't mention Asahikawa without also mentioning the famous Asahiyama Zoo, but also not to be missed in the nearby area of northern Hokkaido are places of interest such as the hot springs in Sounkyo, the lavender fields in Furano, and the hills of Biei that are breathtakingly beautiful at every turn.
